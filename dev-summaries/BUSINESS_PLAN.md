## Technical Implementation Details

### Ruby to Solidity Translation Rules

#### Class → Contract

```ruby
class Token < ERC20
  def initialize(name, symbol)
    @name = name
    @symbol = symbol
  end
end
```

Translates to:

```solidity
contract Token is ERC20 {
    string public name;
    string public symbol;

    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol) {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
    }
}
```

#### Method → Function

```ruby
def transfer(to, amount)
  require(balance_of(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance")
  @balances[msg.sender] -= amount
  @balances[to] += amount
  emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount)
end
```

Translates to:

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
}
```
