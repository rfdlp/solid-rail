# 🚂 SolidRail

> **Bridging Ruby and Ethereum - Write smart contracts in Ruby, generate production-ready Solidity code**

## 🎯 Mission

SolidRail empowers Ruby developers to enter the blockchain space by providing a seamless transpiler that converts Ruby code to Solidity smart contracts. Our mission is to make blockchain development accessible to the Ruby community while maintaining the highest standards of security and performance.

## 🌟 What We Do

- **Ruby to Solidity Transpiler**: Convert Ruby classes and methods to Solidity contracts and functions
- **Type Safety**: Automatic type inference and validation between Ruby and Solidity
- **Gas Optimization**: Built-in strategies for efficient smart contract deployment
- **Security First**: Comprehensive security analysis and best practices enforcement
- **Developer Experience**: Familiar Ruby syntax with powerful blockchain capabilities

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Language**: Ruby 3.0+
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum & EVM-compatible chains
- **Target**: Solidity 0.8.30+
- **Testing**: RSpec, SimpleCov
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: YARD, Markdown

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install SolidRail
gem install solidrail

# Write your first smart contract
class Token < ERC20
  def initialize(name, symbol)
    @name = name
    @symbol = symbol
  end
end

# Generate Solidity
solidrail compile token.rb
```
